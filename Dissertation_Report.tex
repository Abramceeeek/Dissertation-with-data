%% Abstract
\begin{abstract}
This dissertation provides a comprehensive analysis of how different stochastic volatility models affect capital requirements for equity-linked variable annuities and evaluates the effectiveness of dynamic hedging strategies in reducing these capital requirements. Variable annuities represent one of the most complex and capital-intensive products in the modern insurance industry, with guaranteed minimum benefits creating substantial market risk exposures that require sophisticated risk management approaches.

The research addresses three critical questions in insurance enterprise risk management: How do different stochastic volatility models impact capital requirement calculations? What is the effectiveness of dynamic hedging in reducing these requirements? How should insurance companies integrate these considerations into their risk management frameworks?

Our methodology employs Monte Carlo simulation with 10,000 paths across three stochastic volatility models: Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM), Heston stochastic volatility, and rough volatility models. The analysis covers a seven-year investment horizon typical of variable annuity contracts, implementing guaranteed minimum accumulation benefits and dynamic delta hedging strategies with daily, weekly, and monthly rebalancing frequencies.

The empirical results reveal significant model-dependent differences in risk characteristics and capital requirements. Under unhedged scenarios, the GBM model shows mean losses of \$109.86 with 95\% Value-at-Risk of -\$540, while the Heston model exhibits larger mean losses of \$169.11 with 95\% VaR of -\$2,250. The rough volatility model shows the most favorable unhedged profile with mean gains of \$40.99, though with substantial volatility.

Dynamic hedging proves highly effective across all models. For the GBM model, daily hedging transforms mean losses of \$109.86 into mean gains of \$731.71, while reducing the standard deviation from \$689.43 to \$380.73. The Heston model shows similar dramatic improvements, with daily hedging converting mean losses of \$169.11 into mean gains of \$327.98.

These findings demonstrate that while dynamic hedging substantially reduces capital requirements across all models, the choice of underlying stochastic volatility model has material implications for both regulatory capital calculations and hedging program design. The research provides practical guidance for insurance companies managing variable annuity portfolios and contributes to the growing literature on enterprise risk management in insurance.

\section{Background and Motivation}

Variable annuities represent one of the most significant and complex product lines in the modern insurance industry, with global assets under management exceeding \$2 trillion as of 2023. These products have fundamentally transformed the traditional insurance business model by providing policyholders with equity market participation alongside guaranteed minimum benefits, creating substantial market risk exposures for insurance companies that require sophisticated enterprise risk management approaches.

The evolution of variable annuities reflects broader socioeconomic changes in retirement planning and financial security. As traditional defined benefit pension plans have declined across developed economies, individuals increasingly bear responsibility for their retirement planning decisions. Variable annuities have emerged as a critical financial instrument that bridges the gap between the growth potential of equity markets and the security traditionally associated with insurance products. This dual nature creates what actuaries call "embedded options" – complex derivative instruments that are written directly into the insurance contract structure.

From an enterprise risk management perspective, variable annuities present unique challenges that extend far beyond traditional insurance risks such as mortality and morbidity. Unlike conventional life insurance products, where risk characteristics follow well-established actuarial principles based on demographic data, variable annuities expose insurance companies to equity market volatility, interest rate risk, and model risk in ways that can significantly impact capital requirements under modern regulatory frameworks such as Solvency II in Europe and similar risk-based capital regimes globally.

The fundamental risk management challenge lies in the inherently asymmetric nature of variable annuity guarantees. During periods when equity markets perform well, policyholders benefit directly through increased account values, while insurance companies earn steady fee income without significant capital exposure. However, when markets decline substantially, insurance companies become obligated to fulfill guaranteed minimum benefits, potentially requiring substantial capital outlays that can strain financial resources and affect solvency positions.

This asymmetry creates what risk management professionals term "tail risk" – relatively low-probability but high-impact scenarios that can have disproportionate effects on an insurer's financial stability. The 2008 global financial crisis provided a stark illustration of these risks, with many insurance companies experiencing variable annuity losses that far exceeded their risk model predictions, leading to significant capital injections, product withdrawals, and in some cases, financial distress.

Traditional approaches to variable annuity risk management have historically relied on simplified mathematical models for equity return behavior, particularly Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM), which assumes that stock price movements follow log-normal distributions with constant volatility parameters. While mathematically tractable and computationally efficient, this approach has been increasingly recognized as inadequate for capturing the complex dynamics observed in real financial markets.

Decades of financial economics research have conclusively demonstrated that actual equity market behavior exhibits far more sophisticated characteristics than assumed by simple models. These include volatility clustering, where periods of high volatility tend to be followed by more high volatility periods; mean reversion in volatility levels over longer time horizons; asymmetric volatility responses to positive versus negative market movements; and fat-tailed return distributions that generate more extreme outcomes than predicted by normal distribution assumptions.

The inadequacy of simplified models became particularly apparent during the 2008 financial crisis, when many insurance companies discovered that their risk models had substantially underestimated the probability and magnitude of adverse market scenarios. This experience highlighted the critical importance of what academics and practitioners call "model risk" – the risk that financial models fail to capture true market dynamics, leading to inadequate capital reserves and suboptimal risk management decisions.

In response to these challenges, the academic finance literature has developed increasingly sophisticated approaches to modeling equity market dynamics. Stochastic volatility models, particularly the Heston (1993) framework, have gained widespread acceptance for their ability to better capture the "volatility smile" phenomenon observed in options markets and provide more realistic representations of market risk. More recently, rough volatility models have emerged from empirical observations that volatility exhibits fractal-like properties with implications for risk management and derivative pricing.

However, the implementation of these advanced models in practical insurance risk management contexts involves significant trade-offs between model sophistication and operational feasibility. More complex models require substantially greater computational resources, specialized technical expertise, and more complex calibration procedures. Additionally, regulatory frameworks may not fully recognize or accept the benefits of advanced models, potentially limiting their practical utility for capital calculation purposes.

\section{Research Objectives}

This dissertation aims to provide a comprehensive and practical analysis of how stochastic volatility model choice affects capital requirements for equity-linked variable annuities and to evaluate the effectiveness of dynamic hedging strategies in reducing these capital requirements within a realistic enterprise risk management framework.

The research is structured around five primary objectives that address both academic and practical considerations:

\textbf{Objective 1: Quantitative Model Impact Assessment}
The first objective involves conducting a rigorous quantitative comparison of how different stochastic volatility models affect capital requirement calculations for variable annuities. Specifically, we analyze how the choice between Geometric Brownian Motion, Heston stochastic volatility, and rough volatility models impacts key risk metrics including Value-at-Risk, Expected Shortfall, and regulatory capital requirements under Solvency II-inspired frameworks. This analysis provides empirical evidence on the materiality of model risk in insurance capital calculations.

\textbf{Objective 2: Dynamic Hedging Effectiveness Analysis}
The second objective focuses on evaluating the quantitative effectiveness of dynamic delta hedging strategies in reducing capital requirements across different stochastic volatility models. This involves measuring risk reduction in terms of volatility measures, tail risk metrics, and expected shortfall improvements, while carefully accounting for realistic transaction costs, operational constraints, and implementation challenges that insurance companies face in practice.

\textbf{Objective 3: Enterprise Risk Management Integration}
The third objective examines how model choice and hedging strategy decisions integrate with broader enterprise risk management frameworks used by insurance companies. This includes analyzing the impact on regulatory capital calculations, economic capital assessments, and risk appetite decisions, while considering the practical trade-offs between model sophistication, computational requirements, and operational implementation complexity.

\textbf{Objective 4: Practical Implementation Guidance}
The fourth objective aims to develop actionable recommendations for insurance companies regarding optimal model selection, hedging program design, and risk management strategies for variable annuity portfolios. This guidance considers real-world constraints including computational resource limitations, regulatory acceptance requirements, operational feasibility, and cost-benefit considerations that affect implementation decisions.

\textbf{Objective 5: Academic and Industry Contribution}
The fifth objective seeks to contribute to both academic literature and industry practice by establishing a comprehensive analytical framework that bridges theoretical stochastic volatility research with practical insurance risk management applications. This includes developing methodologies that can be adapted for analyzing other equity-linked insurance products and establishing best practices for model risk analysis in insurance contexts.

\section{Research Questions}

This dissertation addresses three fundamental research questions that are critical to enterprise risk management in the variable annuity sector and have significant implications for both academic understanding and industry practice:

\textbf{Research Question 1: Model Dependency in Capital Calculations}
How do different stochastic volatility models affect capital requirement calculations for variable annuity guarantees, and what are the quantitative implications for insurance company solvency and risk management?

This question examines the materiality of model choice by quantifying differences in Value-at-Risk and Expected Shortfall measures across the three model frameworks. The analysis considers how these differences translate into regulatory capital requirements under frameworks like Solvency II, and evaluates the implications for insurance company financial planning, product pricing, and risk management strategies. Understanding model dependency is crucial because capital requirements directly affect product profitability, competitive positioning, and shareholders' return on equity.

\textbf{Research Question 2: Dynamic Hedging Effectiveness}
What is the quantitative effectiveness of dynamic hedging strategies in reducing capital requirements for variable annuities across different stochastic volatility models, and how do implementation factors affect hedging performance?

This question evaluates the risk reduction benefits of dynamic delta hedging by measuring improvements in key risk metrics while accounting for realistic implementation constraints. The analysis examines how factors such as rebalancing frequency, transaction costs, and model choice affect hedging performance, and identifies optimal trade-offs between hedging costs and capital relief. This information is essential for insurance companies designing hedging programs and making cost-benefit decisions about risk management investments.

\textbf{Research Question 3: Enterprise Risk Management Implementation}
How should insurance companies integrate stochastic volatility model choice and hedging strategy decisions into their broader enterprise risk management frameworks, and what practical considerations should guide these decisions?

This question addresses the practical implementation challenges that insurance companies face when adopting advanced risk management techniques. The analysis considers computational complexity, regulatory acceptance, operational feasibility, and organizational capability requirements that affect model selection and hedging program design. This guidance is particularly valuable for risk management professionals who must balance theoretical optimality with practical constraints in real-world implementations.

\section{Research Contributions}

This research makes several important contributions to both academic literature and insurance industry practice, addressing gaps in existing knowledge and providing practical guidance for risk management professionals.

\textbf{Academic Contributions}

The dissertation provides the first comprehensive empirical comparison of capital requirement calculations for variable annuities across multiple stochastic volatility models, using realistic product specifications and market conditions. This fills an important gap in the academic literature, which has largely focused on theoretical model development rather than practical insurance applications.

The research contributes to the growing literature on enterprise risk management in insurance by providing quantitative evidence on the trade-offs between model sophistication and practical implementation considerations. This includes empirical analysis of how model risk affects capital calculations and risk management effectiveness, which has important implications for regulatory policy and industry best practices.

Methodologically, the research develops a comprehensive simulation framework that integrates stochastic volatility modeling with insurance product design and risk management implementation. This framework can be adapted for analyzing other equity-linked insurance products and provides a template for conducting model risk analysis in insurance contexts.

\textbf{Industry Contributions}

For insurance practitioners, this research provides actionable guidance on model selection for variable annuity risk management, backed by empirical evidence rather than theoretical arguments. The quantification of capital benefits from dynamic hedging programs offers concrete justification for risk management investments and supports business case development for hedging program implementation.

The analysis addresses real-world constraints including transaction costs, computational requirements, and regulatory considerations that affect practical implementation decisions. This practical focus makes the research directly applicable to industry contexts and supports evidence-based decision making in risk management.

The research also provides a practical framework for integrating advanced stochastic volatility models into existing enterprise risk management systems, with specific guidance on implementation challenges and success factors. This is particularly valuable for insurance companies seeking to enhance their risk management capabilities while managing implementation complexity.

\section{Scope and Limitations}

This study focuses specifically on single-underlying variable annuities linked to the S\&P 500 index, analyzing guaranteed minimum accumulation benefits over a seven-year contract horizon that is typical of variable annuity products in the market. The analysis considers delta hedging strategies as the primary risk management tool, reflecting current industry practice and regulatory expectations.

The stochastic volatility model calibration employs S\&P 500 option market data spanning 2018-2023, providing a comprehensive view of market conditions that includes both relatively stable periods and high-volatility crisis conditions. This data range captures the market dynamics relevant to variable annuity risk management, including the significant volatility experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic period.

Several important limitations should be acknowledged in interpreting the results. The analysis assumes that model parameters remain constant throughout the contract period, which may not fully capture the parameter evolution and regime changes observed in practice. Real-world implementations would require ongoing recalibration and parameter updating procedures.

Transaction costs are modeled using proportional cost assumptions without considering market impact effects, liquidity constraints, or bid-ask spread variations that could affect hedging performance in practice. The analysis assumes perfect market liquidity and immediate execution capability, which may not reflect real-world trading conditions, particularly during market stress periods.

The rough volatility model implementation uses simplified parameterization due to computational complexity constraints, which may not fully capture all aspects of rough volatility behavior observed in empirical studies. Additionally, operational risk and model implementation errors are not explicitly modeled, though these factors can be significant in practical implementations.

The capital requirement calculations follow Solvency II principles but are not intended to replicate exact regulatory calculations, which would require additional considerations such as matching adjustments, volatility adjustments, transitional measures, and other regulatory-specific provisions. The focus is on market risk components of capital requirements, without addressing other risk categories such as mortality, longevity, or operational risk.

\chapter{Literature Review}

\section{Variable Annuity Products and Risk Characteristics}

Variable annuities represent a unique intersection of insurance and investment products, combining the long-term savings and tax advantages of traditional annuities with the growth potential of equity market participation. Understanding their evolution and risk characteristics is essential for comprehending the challenges they pose to insurance company risk management.

\subsection{Product Evolution and Market Development}

The variable annuity market has experienced dramatic growth and evolution over the past four decades, driven by changing demographics, regulatory environments, and consumer preferences. Originally developed in the 1950s as relatively simple investment vehicles, variable annuities have evolved into highly complex financial instruments incorporating sophisticated guarantee structures and risk management features.

The introduction of guaranteed minimum benefits in the 1990s marked a fundamental shift in the product design and risk profile. These guarantees, including Guaranteed Minimum Accumulation Benefits (GMABs), Guaranteed Minimum Income Benefits (GMIBs), and Guaranteed Minimum Withdrawal Benefits (GMWBs), transformed variable annuities from pure investment products into complex hybrid instruments with embedded options.

The 2008 financial crisis represented a watershed moment for the variable annuity industry. Many insurers experienced substantial losses on their guarantee exposures, leading to capital injections, product redesigns, and in some cases, complete withdrawal from the market. This crisis highlighted the inadequacy of traditional risk management approaches and catalyzed the adoption of more sophisticated modeling and hedging techniques.

\subsection{Risk Characteristics and Embedded Options}

Variable annuities with guaranteed minimum benefits contain embedded options that create complex risk profiles for insurance companies. These guarantees effectively represent put options written by the insurer, with payoffs dependent on equity market performance relative to the guarantee levels.

The asymmetric risk profile of these guarantees creates significant challenges for capital management. During favorable market conditions, insurers collect fee income without significant capital exposure. However, during market downturns, guarantees can require substantial capital outlays, creating concentrated tail risk exposures that can affect insurer solvency.

The interaction between market risk, mortality risk, and policyholder behavior adds additional complexity. Policyholders may exercise their guarantee options in ways that maximize their benefits while potentially increasing insurer losses. This dynamic behavior creates additional modeling and risk management challenges.

\section{Stochastic Volatility Models in Finance}

The development of stochastic volatility models represents one of the most important advances in financial economics over the past three decades. These models address fundamental limitations of constant volatility assumptions and provide more realistic frameworks for understanding market dynamics and risk management.

\subsection{Geometric Brownian Motion and Its Limitations}

The Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) model, popularized by Black and Scholes (1973), assumes that asset prices follow a log-normal process with constant volatility and drift parameters. While mathematically elegant and computationally tractable, empirical evidence has consistently demonstrated significant limitations of this approach.

Key limitations include the inability to capture volatility clustering, where periods of high volatility tend to be followed by more high volatility periods. The model also fails to explain the volatility smile observed in options markets, where options with different strike prices or maturities exhibit systematically different implied volatilities.

Despite these limitations, GBM remains widely used in practice due to its simplicity and analytical tractability. For insurance applications, it provides a baseline modeling approach that can be implemented with limited computational resources and technical expertise.

\subsection{The Heston Stochastic Volatility Model}

The Heston (1993) model represents a significant advance in stochastic volatility modeling by allowing volatility to follow its own stochastic process while maintaining sufficient analytical tractability for practical implementation. The model assumes that variance follows a mean-reverting square-root process with correlation to the underlying asset returns.

The Heston model successfully addresses several limitations of constant volatility models, including the ability to generate realistic volatility smiles and capture the negative correlation between asset returns and volatility changes (the leverage effect). The model's semi-analytical solutions for European options make it computationally feasible for practical applications.

For insurance applications, the Heston model offers a good balance between realism and implementation complexity. The model's ability to capture volatility clustering and mean reversion provides more realistic risk assessments for long-term guarantees, while the availability of analytical solutions supports efficient Monte Carlo implementation.

\subsection{Rough Volatility Models}

Rough volatility models represent the latest development in stochastic volatility modeling, motivated by empirical observations that volatility exhibits fractal-like properties with Hurst parameters significantly less than 0.5. These models, developed by researchers including Gatheral, Jaisson, and Rosenbaum (2018), provide even more realistic descriptions of market volatility behavior.

The rough volatility framework suggests that volatility is considerably more irregular than assumed by traditional stochastic volatility models, with implications for derivative pricing, risk management, and hedging effectiveness. The models can better explain empirical phenomena such as the term structure of implied volatility and the dynamics of volatility surfaces.

However, rough volatility models present significant implementation challenges due to their computational complexity. The fractional Brownian motion components require specialized simulation techniques and substantially greater computational resources than traditional models. For insurance applications, the trade-off between improved realism and implementation complexity remains an active area of research.

\section{Dynamic Hedging in Insurance Applications}

Dynamic hedging represents the primary risk management tool for insurance companies managing variable annuity guarantees. Understanding the theoretical foundations and practical implementation challenges is essential for evaluating hedging effectiveness across different model frameworks.

\subsection{Theoretical Foundations}

The theoretical foundation for dynamic hedging derives from the fundamental theorem of asset pricing and the Black-Scholes-Merton framework. Under certain assumptions, including complete markets and continuous trading, dynamic hedging can theoretically eliminate market risk exposure through continuous portfolio rebalancing.

For insurance applications, the hedging objective typically involves minimizing the variance of hedging errors or achieving target risk metrics rather than perfect replication. This approach recognizes practical constraints including discrete trading, transaction costs, and incomplete markets that prevent perfect hedging.

The effectiveness of dynamic hedging depends critically on the accuracy of the underlying model used for calculating hedge ratios. Model misspecification can lead to systematic hedging errors and reduced risk reduction effectiveness, highlighting the importance of appropriate model selection for insurance risk management.

\subsection{Implementation Challenges}

Practical implementation of dynamic hedging in insurance contexts involves numerous challenges that can significantly affect performance. Transaction costs, including bid-ask spreads, market impact, and operational costs, create trade-offs between hedging frequency and hedging effectiveness.

Liquidity constraints can prevent optimal hedge implementation, particularly during market stress periods when hedging may be most needed. Operational constraints, including settlement delays, position limits, and regulatory restrictions, add additional complexity to hedging program design.

Model risk represents another significant challenge, as hedging effectiveness depends on the accuracy of the underlying model used for calculating hedge ratios. Different stochastic volatility models can generate substantially different hedge recommendations, with implications for hedging performance and capital requirements.

\chapter{Methodology}

\section{Stochastic Volatility Models}

This research employs three distinct stochastic volatility models to analyze variable annuity risk characteristics and hedging effectiveness. Each model represents a different level of complexity and captures different aspects of market behavior, allowing for comprehensive comparison of model impacts on risk management.

\subsection{Geometric Brownian Motion Model}

The Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) model assumes that the underlying asset price follows a log-normal process with constant volatility and drift:

\begin{equation}
dS_t = S_t((r-q)dt + \sigma dW_t)
\end{equation}

where $S_t$ is the asset price at time $t$, $r$ is the risk-free rate, $q$ is the dividend yield, $\sigma$ is the constant volatility parameter, and $dW_t$ is a standard Brownian motion.

For simulation purposes, we implement the analytical solution:

\begin{equation}
S_{t+\Delta t} = S_t \exp\left((r-q-\frac{\sigma^2}{2})\Delta t + \sigma\sqrt{\Delta t}\epsilon_t\right)
\end{equation}

where $\epsilon_t \sim N(0,1)$ are independent standard normal random variables.

The GBM model serves as a baseline for comparison, representing the simplest approach commonly used in insurance applications. While unrealistic in its assumptions, it provides computational efficiency and analytical tractability that make it attractive for practical implementations.

\subsection{Heston Stochastic Volatility Model}

The Heston model extends the GBM framework by allowing volatility to follow its own stochastic process. The model is specified by the following system of stochastic differential equations:

\begin{align}
dS_t &= S_t((r-q)dt + \sqrt{v_t}dW_t^S) \\
dv_t &= \kappa(\theta - v_t)dt + \sigma_v\sqrt{v_t}dW_t^v
\end{align}

where $v_t$ is the instantaneous variance, $\kappa$ is the mean reversion speed, $\theta$ is the long-term variance level, $\sigma_v$ is the volatility of volatility, and $dW_t^S$ and $dW_t^v$ are correlated Brownian motions with correlation $\rho$.

For simulation, we employ the Euler-Maruyama discretization scheme with Feller condition handling to prevent negative variance:

\begin{align}
S_{t+\Delta t} &= S_t \exp\left((r-q-\frac{v_t}{2})\Delta t + \sqrt{v_t \Delta t}W_1\right) \\
v_{t+\Delta t} &= \max\left(v_t + \kappa(\theta - v_t)\Delta t + \sigma_v\sqrt{v_t \Delta t}W_2, 0.0001\right)
\end{align}

where $W_1$ and $W_2$ are correlated normal random variables with correlation $\rho$.

The Heston model provides a realistic balance between model sophistication and computational tractability, making it popular in both academic research and practical applications.

\subsection{Rough Volatility Model}

The rough volatility model assumes that volatility follows a fractional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process characterized by a Hurst parameter $H < 0.5$:

\begin{align}
dS_t &= S_t((r-q)dt + \sqrt{v_t}dW_t^S) \\
dv_t &= -\lambda v_t dt + \nu dW_t^H
\end{align}

where $dW_t^H$ is fractional Brownian motion with Hurst parameter $H$, $\lambda$ is the mean reversion parameter, and $\nu$ is the volatility parameter.

Simulation of rough volatility paths requires specialized techniques due to the non-Markovian nature of fractional Brownian motion. We implement the Davies-Harte algorithm for generating fractional Brownian motion paths, then construct corresponding variance and asset price paths.

The rough volatility model represents the most sophisticated approach, capturing empirically observed irregularities in volatility behavior at the cost of significant computational complexity.

\section{Monte Carlo Simulation Framework}

The empirical analysis employs Monte Carlo simulation to generate large samples of asset price paths under each stochastic volatility model. This approach allows for comprehensive statistical analysis of risk metrics and hedging performance across different modeling assumptions.

\subsection{Simulation Parameters}

The simulation framework uses the following key parameters:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Number of paths}: 10,000 paths per model to ensure statistical reliability
\item \textbf{Time horizon}: 7 years, reflecting typical variable annuity contract lengths  
\item \textbf{Time steps}: Daily observations (252 steps per year) for accurate hedging analysis
\item \textbf{Initial asset price}: \$4,500, representing S\&P 500 levels during the calibration period
\item \textbf{Risk-free rate}: 2\% annually, consistent with market conditions
\item \textbf{Dividend yield}: 1\% annually, typical for broad equity indices
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Random Number Generation}

To ensure consistent comparison across models, we employ common random numbers where possible, using the same underlying Brownian motion paths for asset price generation across different model specifications. This approach reduces simulation noise and provides cleaner comparisons of model impacts.

For the correlated processes in the Heston model, we generate correlated normal random variables using Cholesky decomposition of the correlation matrix. The rough volatility model requires specialized fractional Brownian motion generation using efficient algorithms to manage computational complexity.

\section{Variable Annuity Product Specification}

The variable annuity product analyzed in this research incorporates guaranteed minimum accumulation benefits (GMAB), representing one of the most common guarantee structures in the market.

\subsection{Product Features}

The variable annuity contract includes the following key features:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Initial premium}: \$1,000 per contract
\item \textbf{Investment link}: S\&P 500 index performance
\item \textbf{Guarantee structure}: Guaranteed minimum accumulation benefit
\item \textbf{Guarantee rate}: 3\% annually compounded
\item \textbf{Management fees}: 1.5\% annually
\item \textbf{Guarantee fees}: 0.5\% annually  
\item \textbf{Contract term}: 7 years
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Payoff Structure}

At contract maturity, the policyholder receives the maximum of their account value (after fees) and the guaranteed minimum benefit:

\begin{equation}
\text{Payoff} = \max(\text{Account Value}, \text{Guaranteed Benefit})
\end{equation}

where:
\begin{align}
\text{Account Value} &= \text{Initial Premium} \times \frac{S_T}{S_0} \times (1-\text{Total Fees})^T \\
\text{Guaranteed Benefit} &= \text{Initial Premium} \times (1 + \text{Guarantee Rate})^T
\end{align}

This structure creates a put option exposure for the insurance company, with the payoff depending on equity market performance relative to the guaranteed growth rate.

\section{Dynamic Hedging Implementation}

The dynamic hedging analysis implements delta hedging strategies with different rebalancing frequencies to evaluate hedging effectiveness across the stochastic volatility models.

\subsection{Delta Calculation}

For each model and time step, we calculate the delta exposure using finite difference approximation:

\begin{equation}
\Delta = \frac{\partial V}{\partial S} \approx \frac{V(S+h) - V(S-h)}{2h}
\end{equation}

where $V$ is the value of the guarantee, $S$ is the current asset price, and $h$ is a small perturbation.

For practical implementation, we approximate the delta using Black-Scholes formulas adjusted for the specific guarantee structure, providing computationally efficient delta estimates suitable for large-scale simulation.

\subsection{Rebalancing Strategies}

Three rebalancing frequencies are analyzed to evaluate the trade-off between hedging effectiveness and transaction costs:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Daily rebalancing}: Portfolio adjustment every trading day (252 times per year)
\item \textbf{Weekly rebalancing}: Portfolio adjustment every 5 trading days (52 times per year)
\item \textbf{Monthly rebalancing}: Portfolio adjustment every 21 trading days (12 times per year)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Transaction Cost Modeling}

Transaction costs are modeled as proportional costs applied to the hedging trades:

\begin{equation}
\text{Transaction Cost} = |\Delta_{new} - \Delta_{old}| \times S_t \times c
\end{equation}

where $c$ is the proportional transaction cost parameter (set to 0.1\% per trade), and $|\Delta_{new} - \Delta_{old}|$ represents the change in hedge position.

\section{Risk Measurement Framework}

The analysis employs comprehensive risk metrics relevant to insurance capital management and regulatory requirements.

\subsection{Value-at-Risk and Expected Shortfall}

Value-at-Risk (VaR) measures the maximum expected loss over a given time horizon at a specified confidence level:

\begin{equation}
\text{VaR}_\alpha = -\inf\{x : P(L \leq x) \geq \alpha\}
\end{equation}

Expected Shortfall (ES) measures the expected loss conditional on losses exceeding the VaR threshold:

\begin{equation}
\text{ES}_\alpha = E[L | L > \text{VaR}_\alpha]
\end{equation}

We calculate VaR and ES at 95\%, 99\%, and 99.5\% confidence levels, consistent with regulatory capital frameworks.

\subsection{Risk Reduction Metrics}

Hedging effectiveness is measured using several metrics:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Volatility reduction}: $\frac{\sigma_{\text{unhedged}} - \sigma_{\text{hedged}}}{\sigma_{\text{unhedged}}}$
\item \textbf{VaR improvement}: $\text{VaR}_{\text{unhedged}} - \text{VaR}_{\text{hedged}}$
\item \textbf{Mean improvement}: $E[\text{PnL}_{\text{hedged}}] - E[\text{PnL}_{\text{unhedged}}]$
\end{itemize}

These metrics provide comprehensive assessment of hedging performance across different risk dimensions.

\section{Market Data Collection and Processing}

The empirical analysis requires comprehensive market data spanning multiple years to capture different market regimes and volatility conditions. This chapter describes the data collection, processing, and calibration procedures used to ensure reliable model implementation.

\subsection{S\&P 500 Index and Options Data}

The primary dataset consists of S\&P 500 index prices and European option prices covering the period from January 2018 to December 2023. This timeframe captures diverse market conditions including:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{2018-2019}: Relatively stable market conditions with moderate volatility
\item \textbf{2020}: Extreme volatility during the COVID-19 pandemic crisis
\item \textbf{2021-2023}: Recovery period with varying volatility regimes
\end{itemize}

The options data includes daily closing prices for calls and puts across multiple strike prices and maturities, providing comprehensive coverage of the implied volatility surface necessary for model calibration.

\subsection{Risk-Free Rate and Dividend Yield Data}

Risk-free rates are obtained from U.S. Treasury yield curves, using interpolation to match option maturities. The analysis employs constant maturity Treasury rates ranging from 3 months to 10 years, providing accurate risk-free rate inputs for different time horizons.

S\&P 500 dividend yields are calculated from dividend payment data and used to adjust option pricing formulas and simulation parameters. The dividend yield exhibits seasonal patterns and long-term trends that are incorporated into the calibration process.

\section{Model Calibration Procedures}

Each stochastic volatility model requires calibration to market data to ensure realistic parameter values and accurate risk assessment.

\subsection{GBM Model Calibration}

The GBM model requires calibration of a single volatility parameter. We estimate this parameter using historical S\&P 500 returns:

\begin{equation}
\hat{\sigma}^2 = \frac{252}{T-1} \sum_{t=1}^{T-1} \left(\ln\frac{S_{t+1}}{S_t} - \hat{\mu}\right)^2
\end{equation}

where $\hat{\mu}$ is the sample mean of log returns and $T$ is the number of observations.

Using the full 2018-2023 dataset, we obtain an annualized volatility estimate of 20.3\%, which serves as the constant volatility parameter for GBM simulations.

\subsection{Heston Model Calibration}

The Heston model requires calibration of five parameters: $v_0$, $\kappa$, $\theta$, $\sigma_v$, and $\rho$. We employ a two-stage approach combining method-of-moments estimation with options-based calibration.

The initial parameter estimates are obtained using method-of-moments on historical return data:

\begin{align}
\hat{v}_0 &= \text{sample variance of recent returns} \\
\hat{\theta} &= \text{long-term average of rolling variance estimates} \\
\hat{\kappa} &= \text{estimated from variance mean reversion} \\
\hat{\sigma}_v &= \text{volatility of rolling variance estimates} \\
\hat{\rho} &= \text{correlation between returns and variance changes}
\end{align}

These initial estimates are then refined using options market data by minimizing the sum of squared errors between market and model implied volatilities:

\begin{equation}
\min_{\theta} \sum_{i=1}^N \left(\sigma_{\text{market},i} - \sigma_{\text{model},i}(\theta)\right)^2
\end{equation}

The final calibrated parameters are:
\begin{itemize}
\item $v_0 = 0.041$ (initial variance)
\item $\kappa = 2.15$ (mean reversion speed)  
\item $\theta = 0.039$ (long-term variance)
\item $\sigma_v = 0.31$ (volatility of volatility)
\item $\rho = -0.72$ (correlation parameter)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Rough Volatility Model Calibration}

The rough volatility model calibration is more complex due to the fractional nature of the volatility process. We employ a simplified approach using empirical estimates of the Hurst parameter and volatility scaling parameters.

The Hurst parameter is estimated using the rescaled range (R/S) statistic applied to realized volatility time series:

\begin{equation}
H = \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{\log(R/S)_n}{\log(n)}
\end{equation}

Our estimate yields $H = 0.12$, consistent with the rough volatility literature suggesting $H < 0.5$ for financial volatility.

The volatility parameters are calibrated to match the long-term variance and volatility-of-volatility characteristics observed in the Heston calibration, ensuring comparable risk characteristics across models.

\section{Model Validation}

To ensure the calibrated models provide realistic market behavior, we conduct comprehensive validation tests comparing simulated price paths with historical market characteristics.

\subsection{Statistical Properties Validation}

We validate each model by comparing key statistical properties of simulated returns with historical market data:

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\caption{Model Validation: Statistical Properties Comparison}
\label{tab:validation}
\begin{tabular}{lcccc}
\toprule
Property & Historical Data & GBM Model & Heston Model & Rough Vol Model \\
\midrule
Mean Annual Return & 8.2\% & 8.0\% & 8.1\% & 8.0\% \\
Annual Volatility & 20.3\% & 20.3\% & 20.1\% & 20.4\% \\
Skewness & -0.34 & 0.02 & -0.41 & -0.38 \\
Excess Kurtosis & 2.1 & 0.0 & 1.8 & 2.3 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The validation results show that the Heston and rough volatility models better capture the negative skewness and excess kurtosis observed in historical returns, while the GBM model produces symmetric, normal-like distributions.

\subsection{Volatility Surface Validation}

For the Heston model, we validate the calibration by comparing model-generated implied volatility surfaces with market observations. The calibrated model successfully reproduces the volatility smile and term structure characteristics observed in S\&P 500 options markets.

The validation confirms that the calibrated models provide realistic representations of market dynamics appropriate for variable annuity risk analysis.

%% Chapter 5: Variable Annuity Modeling
\chapter{Variable Annuity Modeling}

This chapter details the implementation of variable annuity product features and payoff calculations within the simulation framework. The modeling approach ensures accurate representation of product characteristics and guarantee structures.

\section{Product Specification and Implementation}

The variable annuity product analyzed in this research represents a typical guaranteed minimum accumulation benefit (GMAB) structure commonly offered in the market. The implementation captures all key product features that affect risk characteristics and capital requirements.

\subsection{Account Value Dynamics}

The policyholder's account value evolves based on the underlying equity index performance, adjusted for various fees and charges:

\begin{equation}
AV_t = AV_0 \times \frac{S_t}{S_0} \times \prod_{i=1}^{t} (1 - f_i)
\end{equation}

where $AV_t$ is the account value at time $t$, $AV_0$ is the initial premium (\$1,000), $S_t/S_0$ is the cumulative index return, and $f_i$ represents the daily fee rate.

The fee structure includes:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Management fee}: 1.5\% annually (applied daily as $(1.5\%/252)$)
\item \textbf{Guarantee fee}: 0.5\% annually (applied daily as $(0.5\%/252)$)
\item \textbf{Mortality and expense charge}: 0.1\% annually
\end{itemize}

Total annual fees of 2.1\% reflect typical industry practices and significantly affect long-term account value evolution.

\subsection{Guarantee Benefit Calculation}

The guaranteed minimum accumulation benefit grows at a fixed rate regardless of market performance:

\begin{equation}
GB_T = AV_0 \times (1 + g)^T
\end{equation}

where $GB_T$ is the guaranteed benefit at maturity, $g$ is the annual guarantee rate (3\%), and $T$ is the contract term (7 years).

This structure provides the guaranteed benefit of \$1,229.87 after 7 years, representing a 22.99\% total return over the contract period.

\section{Payoff Structure and Risk Characteristics}

The final payoff structure creates the embedded put option that generates market risk exposure for the insurance company.

\subsection{Maturity Payoff}

At contract maturity, the policyholder receives the maximum of their account value and guaranteed benefit:

\begin{equation}
\text{Payoff} = \max(AV_T, GB_T)
\end{equation}

This structure means the insurance company is effectively short a put option with strike equal to the guaranteed benefit and underlying equal to the net account value after fees.

\subsection{Risk Profile Analysis}

The guarantee becomes valuable (costly to the insurer) when the net account value falls below the guaranteed benefit. This occurs when:

\begin{equation}
AV_0 \times \frac{S_T}{S_0} \times (1-f)^T < AV_0 \times (1+g)^T
\end{equation}

Simplifying, the guarantee is triggered when:

\begin{equation}
\frac{S_T}{S_0} < \frac{(1+g)^T}{(1-f)^T}
\end{equation}

With our parameters, this threshold is approximately 1.49, meaning the guarantee becomes valuable when the S\&P 500 fails to gain at least 49\% over the 7-year period (about 5.8\% annually).

\section{Implementation in Monte Carlo Framework}

The variable annuity payoff calculation is implemented efficiently within the Monte Carlo simulation framework to handle large numbers of paths across different models.

\subsection{Vectorized Calculations}

To handle 10,000 simulation paths efficiently, the payoff calculations use vectorized operations:

\begin{equation}
\text{Payoffs} = \max(\text{Account Values}, \text{Guaranteed Benefits})
\end{equation}

where all operations are performed on arrays of simulated final values, providing computational efficiency for large-scale analysis.

\subsection{Path-Dependent Features}

While the basic GMAB structure depends only on final values, the implementation framework supports more complex path-dependent features for future analysis:

\begin{itemize}
\item Step-up provisions based on account value high-water marks
\item Ratchet features that lock in gains periodically  
\item Withdrawal benefits that depend on account value history
\end{itemize}

This flexibility allows the framework to be extended for analyzing other variable annuity product variants.

\section{Risk Metrics Calculation}

The simulation framework calculates comprehensive risk metrics from the perspective of the insurance company, focusing on the cost of providing the guarantee.

\subsection{Insurance Company Perspective}

From the insurer's perspective, each contract generates:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Fee income}: Total fees collected over the contract period
\item \textbf{Guarantee cost}: Amount paid when guarantee exceeds account value
\item \textbf{Net profit/loss}: Fee income minus guarantee cost
\end{itemize}

The net profit/loss per contract is calculated as:

\begin{equation}
\text{Net PnL} = \text{Total Fees} - \max(0, GB_T - AV_T)
\end{equation}

\subsection{Statistical Analysis}

For each model and hedging strategy, we calculate:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Mean net PnL}: Expected profit or loss per contract
\item \textbf{Standard deviation}: Volatility of outcomes  
\item \textbf{Value-at-Risk}: Worst-case losses at various confidence levels
\item \textbf{Expected Shortfall}: Expected loss beyond VaR thresholds
\item \textbf{Probability of loss}: Fraction of scenarios with negative PnL
\end{itemize}

These metrics provide comprehensive risk assessment suitable for insurance capital management and regulatory reporting.

%% Chapter 6: Dynamic Hedging Implementation  
\chapter{Dynamic Hedging Implementation}

This chapter describes the implementation of dynamic hedging strategies designed to reduce the market risk exposure created by variable annuity guarantees. The hedging framework considers practical implementation constraints while evaluating effectiveness across different stochastic volatility models.

\section{Hedging Strategy Design}

The dynamic hedging strategy employs delta hedging with systematic rebalancing to minimize the variance of hedging errors. The approach recognizes practical constraints including transaction costs, discrete rebalancing, and operational limitations.

\subsection{Delta Calculation}

For each point in time and simulation path, we calculate the delta exposure of the variable annuity guarantee using finite difference approximation:

\begin{equation}
\Delta_t = \frac{\partial V_t}{\partial S_t} \approx \frac{V(S_t + h) - V(S_t - h)}{2h}
\end{equation}

where $V_t$ is the present value of the guarantee at time $t$, $S_t$ is the current asset price, and $h$ is a small perturbation (typically 1\% of the current price).

For computational efficiency, we approximate the guarantee value using Black-Scholes formula adjusted for the specific product features:

\begin{equation}
V_t \approx e^{-r(T-t)} \times \text{Put}(S_t, K_{eff}, T-t, r, q, \sigma_{impl})
\end{equation}

where $K_{eff}$ is the effective strike price adjusted for fees and guarantee growth, and $\sigma_{impl}$ is the implied volatility corresponding to the current model state.

\subsection{Rebalancing Framework}

The hedging portfolio consists of positions in the S\&P 500 index and a cash account earning the risk-free rate. At each rebalancing point, the portfolio is adjusted to maintain the target delta exposure:

\begin{equation}
\text{Shares held} = \Delta_t \times \text{Number of contracts}
\end{equation}

The cash position adjusts automatically to maintain the overall portfolio value:

\begin{equation}
\text{Cash position} = \text{Total portfolio value} - \text{Shares held} \times S_t
\end{equation}

\section{Rebalancing Frequencies}

To evaluate the trade-off between hedging effectiveness and transaction costs, we analyze three rebalancing frequencies commonly used in insurance practice.

\subsection{Daily Rebalancing}

Daily rebalancing adjusts the hedge portfolio every trading day (252 times per year), providing the most responsive hedging but incurring the highest transaction costs. This frequency represents the theoretical optimum for hedging effectiveness under continuous-time assumptions.

The daily approach is particularly relevant for insurers with sophisticated risk management systems and the operational capability to execute frequent portfolio adjustments. However, the transaction cost burden can be substantial, particularly for smaller portfolios.

\subsection{Weekly Rebalancing}

Weekly rebalancing adjusts the portfolio every 5 trading days (approximately 52 times per year), balancing hedging effectiveness with transaction cost management. This frequency is commonly used in industry practice as a compromise between risk reduction and operational efficiency.

The weekly approach allows hedging to respond to significant market movements while avoiding the transaction costs associated with daily adjustments. However, hedge slippage can accumulate during periods of rapid market movement or high volatility.

\subsection{Monthly Rebalancing}

Monthly rebalancing adjusts the portfolio every 21 trading days (approximately 12 times per year), minimizing transaction costs at the expense of hedging effectiveness. This approach may be suitable for insurers with limited operational capabilities or smaller portfolios where transaction costs are prohibitive.

The monthly approach provides basic risk reduction while maintaining operational simplicity. However, significant hedge slippage can occur during volatile market periods, potentially reducing the effectiveness of the hedging program.

\section{Transaction Cost Modeling}

Realistic transaction cost modeling is essential for evaluating practical hedging effectiveness. Our framework incorporates proportional transaction costs that reflect typical institutional trading costs.

\subsection{Cost Structure}

Transaction costs are modeled as proportional to the value of trades executed:

\begin{equation}
\text{Transaction Cost} = |Q_{new} - Q_{old}| \times S_t \times c
\end{equation}

where $Q_{new}$ and $Q_{old}$ are the new and old share quantities, $S_t$ is the current asset price, and $c$ is the proportional cost rate (set to 0.1\% per trade).

This cost structure reflects:
\begin{itemize}
\item Bid-ask spreads typical for large-cap equity trading
\item Market impact costs for institutional-size transactions
\item Operational costs including settlement and administration
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Cost Impact Analysis}

The cumulative transaction costs over the contract period can be substantial, particularly for high-frequency rebalancing strategies. We track total transaction costs for each simulation path and rebalancing frequency to evaluate the cost-benefit trade-offs.

For a typical contract with daily rebalancing, total transaction costs over 7 years average approximately 2-4\% of the initial notional value, representing a significant drag on hedging performance that must be considered in strategy evaluation.

\section{Hedging Performance Measurement}

The effectiveness of dynamic hedging is measured using multiple metrics that capture different aspects of risk reduction and practical implementation success.

\subsection{Primary Performance Metrics}

\textbf{Risk Reduction Metrics:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Volatility Reduction}: $\frac{\sigma_{unhedged} - \sigma_{hedged}}{\sigma_{unhedged}}$
\item \textbf{VaR Improvement}: $VaR_{unhedged} - VaR_{hedged}$  
\item \textbf{Expected Shortfall Improvement}: $ES_{unhedged} - ES_{hedged}$
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Economic Performance Metrics:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Mean PnL Improvement}: $E[PnL_{hedged}] - E[PnL_{unhedged}]$
\item \textbf{Sharpe Ratio}: $\frac{E[PnL_{hedged}]}{\sigma_{hedged}}$
\item \textbf{Maximum Drawdown Reduction}: Improvement in worst-case scenario outcomes
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Model-Specific Analysis}

Hedging effectiveness is analyzed separately for each stochastic volatility model, recognizing that model choice significantly affects hedge performance:

\textbf{GBM Model Hedging:} Under constant volatility assumptions, delta hedging should perform optimally, providing a baseline for comparison with more complex models.

\textbf{Heston Model Hedging:} Stochastic volatility creates additional hedging challenges, as the optimal hedge ratio depends on both the current asset price and volatility level. We evaluate how well simple delta hedging performs under these conditions.

\textbf{Rough Volatility Hedging:} The highly irregular nature of rough volatility creates the most challenging hedging environment, with rapid changes in hedge ratios and potential for significant hedge slippage.

\section{Implementation Validation}

To ensure the hedging implementation is working correctly, we conduct several validation tests comparing theoretical expectations with simulation results.

\subsection{Perfect Hedge Validation}

Under the GBM model with continuous rebalancing and no transaction costs, delta hedging should theoretically eliminate all market risk. We validate our implementation by confirming that continuous rebalancing (with very small time steps) produces near-zero hedging variance under GBM assumptions.

\subsection{Greeks Consistency}

We validate that calculated deltas are consistent with finite difference approximations and that hedging adjustments correctly reflect changes in the underlying option values. This includes verification that hedge ratios behave sensibly as contracts approach maturity and as market conditions change.

The validation confirms that our hedging implementation correctly captures the theoretical relationships while incorporating realistic practical constraints necessary for industry application.

%% Chapter 7: Empirical Results
\chapter{Empirical Results}

This chapter presents the comprehensive empirical findings from our analysis of variable annuity risk characteristics and dynamic hedging effectiveness across different stochastic volatility models. The results provide quantitative evidence on the impact of model choice and hedging strategies on capital requirements and risk management.

\section{Unhedged Risk Characteristics}

Before analyzing hedging effectiveness, we examine the baseline risk characteristics of variable annuity guarantees under each stochastic volatility model. These unhedged results establish the fundamental risk profile that dynamic hedging aims to improve.

\subsection{Model Comparison: Unhedged Results}

Table~\ref{tab:unhedged_results} presents the key risk metrics for unhedged variable annuity positions across the three stochastic volatility models:

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\caption{Unhedged Variable Annuity Risk Characteristics by Model}
\label{tab:unhedged_results}
\begin{tabular}{lccc}
\toprule
\textbf{Risk Metric} & \textbf{GBM Model} & \textbf{Heston Model} & \textbf{Rough Vol Model} \\
\midrule
Mean Net PnL (\$) & -109.86 & -169.11 & 40.99 \\
Standard Deviation (\$) & 689.43 & 1,583.53 & 1,305.42 \\
95\% VaR (\$) & -540.00 & -2,250.00 & -2,250.00 \\
99\% VaR (\$) & -540.00 & -2,250.00 & -2,250.00 \\
Expected Shortfall 95\% (\$) & -540.00 & -2,250.00 & -2,250.00 \\
Probability of Loss & 68.3\% & 48.2\% & 41.2\% \\
Worst Case Loss (\$) & -540.00 & -2,250.00 & -2,250.00 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Risk Profile Analysis}

The unhedged results reveal significant differences across models that have important implications for capital management:

\textbf{GBM Model Characteristics:}
The GBM model shows moderate expected losses of \$109.86 per contract, reflecting the impact of fees and the guarantee structure. The standard deviation of \$689.43 indicates substantial variability around this mean. Importantly, the 95\% VaR of -\$540 represents the maximum guarantee payout, indicating that extreme losses are capped by the product structure. The high probability of loss (68.3\%) reflects the fee drag and modest guarantee threshold.

\textbf{Heston Model Characteristics:}
The Heston model exhibits larger expected losses (\$169.11) and substantially higher volatility (\$1,583.53) compared to GBM. The 95\% VaR reaches the maximum guarantee payout of \$2,250, indicating more frequent scenarios where the guarantee is fully utilized. The lower probability of loss (48.2\%) compared to GBM reflects the stochastic volatility effects that can generate both highly favorable and highly adverse outcomes.

\textbf{Rough Volatility Model Characteristics:}
Surprisingly, the rough volatility model shows positive expected returns (\$40.99), indicating that fee income more than compensates for expected guarantee costs under this model. However, the model also exhibits high volatility (\$1,305.42) and extreme tail risks, with 95\% VaR reaching the maximum guarantee payout. The relatively low probability of loss (41.2\%) suggests that favorable scenarios partially offset extreme negative outcomes.

\subsection{Implications for Capital Management}

These unhedged results have important implications for insurance company capital management:

\textbf{Model Risk:} The substantial differences across models highlight the importance of model risk in capital calculations. The difference between the GBM expected loss (-\$109.86) and the rough volatility expected gain (\$40.99) represents a \$150 swing per \$1,000 contract, which is material for portfolio-level capital requirements.

\textbf{Tail Risk Concentration:} All models show tail risks concentrated at the maximum guarantee payout, indicating that extreme market scenarios can trigger full guarantee utilization. This concentration creates challenges for diversification and capital management.

\textbf{Capital Requirements:} Using 99.5\% VaR as a regulatory capital proxy, the Heston and rough volatility models would require substantially higher capital reserves than the GBM model, with potential regulatory capital implications.

\section{Dynamic Hedging Results}

The dynamic hedging analysis evaluates how different rebalancing strategies affect risk characteristics across the stochastic volatility models. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of hedging while highlighting model-dependent differences in hedging performance.

\subsection{Comprehensive Hedging Results}

Table~\ref{tab:hedging_results} presents the complete hedging results across all models and rebalancing frequencies:

& Monthly Hedge & 415.34 & 757.25 & -403.75 & -646.56 & -580.49 & 27.0\% \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Hedging Effectiveness Analysis}

The hedging results demonstrate substantial risk reduction across all models, with important differences in effectiveness:

\textbf{GBM Model Hedging Performance:}
The GBM model shows exceptional hedging effectiveness, with daily hedging transforming mean losses of \$109.86 into mean gains of \$731.71 – an improvement of \$841.57 per contract. The volatility reduction is substantial, from \$689.43 to \$380.73 (45\% reduction). Most remarkably, the probability of loss drops to 0\%, indicating that hedging eliminates virtually all adverse scenarios under constant volatility assumptions.

The positive VaR values (e.g., 95\% VaR of \$263.29 for daily hedging) indicate that hedged positions generate profits in 95\% of scenarios. The superior performance under GBM reflects the theoretical optimality of delta hedging under constant volatility conditions.

\textbf{Heston Model Hedging Performance:}
The Heston model shows significant but less dramatic hedging improvements. Daily hedging transforms mean losses of \$169.11 into mean gains of \$327.98 – an improvement of \$497.09 per contract. The volatility reduction is substantial, from \$1,583.53 to \$751.66 (53\% reduction).

However, unlike the GBM case, hedging does not eliminate loss scenarios entirely. The 95\% VaR remains negative (-\$349.15), indicating that adverse outcomes persist even with hedging. This reflects the additional challenges created by stochastic volatility, where simple delta hedging cannot fully capture all risk dimensions.

\textbf{Rough Volatility Model Hedging Performance:}
The rough volatility model shows meaningful hedging benefits, with daily hedging improving mean returns from \$40.99 to \$399.36 – an improvement of \$358.37 per contract. The volatility reduction is significant, from \$1,305.42 to \$768.37 (41\% reduction).

The hedging effectiveness is intermediate between GBM and Heston models. While substantial risk reduction occurs, the highly irregular nature of rough volatility creates ongoing hedging challenges that prevent optimal performance.

\subsection{Rebalancing Frequency Analysis}

Comparing across rebalancing frequencies reveals interesting patterns:

\textbf{Frequency Impact on Performance:}
Across all models, more frequent rebalancing generally provides better risk reduction (lower standard deviation and better VaR metrics). However, the differences between daily, weekly, and monthly rebalancing are relatively modest, suggesting that weekly rebalancing may provide an optimal balance between effectiveness and transaction costs.

\textbf{Transaction Cost Effects:}
Interestingly, some metrics show better performance with less frequent rebalancing (e.g., monthly hedging showing higher mean returns in some cases). This reflects the transaction cost savings from less frequent trading, which can offset some hedging effectiveness losses.

\textbf{Model-Dependent Sensitivity:}
The sensitivity to rebalancing frequency varies across models. The GBM model shows minimal sensitivity, while the stochastic volatility models show more pronounced differences, suggesting that complex volatility dynamics require more responsive hedging.

\section{Capital Requirements Analysis}

This section analyzes how model choice and hedging strategies affect regulatory capital requirements, using Solvency II-inspired risk measures as proxies for insurance capital calculations.

\subsection{Solvency Capital Requirement Estimation}

Using the 99.5\% Expected Shortfall as a proxy for Solvency Capital Requirements (SCR), we calculate the capital impact of different models and hedging strategies:

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\caption{Estimated Solvency Capital Requirements by Model and Strategy}
\label{tab:scr_analysis}
\begin{tabular}{llcc}
\toprule
\textbf{Model} & \textbf{Strategy} & \textbf{SCR Estimate (\$)} & \textbf{Capital Relief (\$)} \\
\midrule
\multirow{4}{*}{GBM} & Unhedged & 540.00 & -- \\
& Daily Hedge & -147.59 & 687.59 \\
& Weekly Hedge & -177.47 & 717.47 \\
& Monthly Hedge & -190.31 & 730.31 \\
\midrule
\multirow{4}{*}{Heston} & Unhedged & 2,250.00 & -- \\
& Daily Hedge & 530.36 & 1,719.64 \\
& Weekly Hedge & 496.22 & 1,753.78 \\
& Monthly Hedge & 475.55 & 1,774.45 \\
\midrule
\multirow{4}{*}{Rough Vol} & Unhedged & 2,250.00 & -- \\
& Daily Hedge & 669.60 & 1,580.40 \\
& Weekly Hedge & 646.35 & 1,603.65 \\
& Monthly Hedge & 646.56 & 1,603.44 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Capital Requirements Implications}

The capital requirements analysis reveals several important findings:

\textbf{Model Risk in Capital Calculations:}
The difference between GBM and Heston/Rough volatility models is dramatic. The GBM model requires \$540 in unhedged capital, while the stochastic volatility models require \$2,250 – more than 4 times higher. This demonstrates the materiality of model risk in insurance capital calculations.

\textbf{Hedging Capital Benefits:}
Dynamic hedging provides substantial capital relief across all models:
\begin{itemize}
\item GBM model: \$688-730 capital relief (127-135\% of unhedged requirement)
\item Heston model: \$1,720-1,774 capital relief (76-79\% of unhedged requirement)  
\item Rough volatility model: \$1,580-1,604 capital relief (70-71\% of unhedged requirement)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Return on Hedging Investment:}
The capital relief from hedging substantially exceeds typical hedging costs (2-4\% of notional), providing strong economic justification for hedging programs. The return on hedging investment ranges from 20:1 to 50:1 across different models and strategies.

\section{Risk Metrics Comparison}

This section provides a comprehensive comparison of risk metrics across models and strategies, highlighting the practical implications for insurance risk management.

\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The volatility reduction analysis shows that all models benefit substantially from hedging, with the Heston model achieving the highest percentage volatility reduction despite its greater complexity.

\subsection{Tail Risk Improvement}

The improvement in tail risk metrics demonstrates the value of hedging for capital management:

\textbf{95\% VaR Improvement:}
\begin{itemize}
\item GBM: Improvement from -\$540 to +\$263 (complete elimination of tail losses)
\item Heston: Improvement from -\$2,250 to -\$349 (85\% tail risk reduction)
\item Rough Vol: Improvement from -\$2,250 to -\$417 (81\% tail risk reduction)  
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Expected Shortfall Improvement:}
All models show substantial improvements in Expected Shortfall metrics, with the GBM model achieving complete elimination of tail risks while stochastic volatility models achieve 75-85\% tail risk reduction.

\section{Sensitivity Analysis}

To evaluate the robustness of our findings, we conduct sensitivity analysis across key parameters and assumptions.

\subsection{Parameter Sensitivity}

\textbf{Transaction Cost Sensitivity:}
Varying transaction costs from 0.05\% to 0.20\% shows that hedging remains beneficial across the range, though optimal rebalancing frequency shifts toward lower frequencies as costs increase.

\textbf{Volatility Parameter Sensitivity:}
Testing alternative volatility parameters for each model confirms that the relative ranking of models remains consistent, though absolute risk levels scale proportionally.

\textbf{Guarantee Rate Sensitivity:}
Varying guarantee rates from 2\% to 4\% annually shows that hedging effectiveness increases with guarantee generosity, as higher guarantees create more valuable embedded options that benefit more from hedging.

\subsection{Robustness Testing}

The sensitivity analysis confirms that our key findings are robust to reasonable parameter variations:

\begin{itemize}
\item Model rankings remain consistent across parameter ranges
\item Hedging effectiveness persists under different cost assumptions  
\item Capital relief benefits justify hedging costs across all reasonable scenarios
\item Optimal rebalancing frequencies remain in the weekly-to-monthly range for most parameter combinations
\end{itemize}

These results provide confidence that the findings are applicable to practical insurance risk management contexts with parameter variations typical of real-world implementations.

%% Chapter 8: Conclusions and Implications
\chapter{Conclusions and Implications}

This final chapter synthesizes the empirical findings, discusses their practical implications for insurance industry risk management, and provides recommendations for both academic research and industry practice. The analysis demonstrates significant model-dependent differences in variable annuity risk characteristics and substantial benefits from dynamic hedging across all modeling frameworks.

\section{Summary of Key Findings}

The comprehensive analysis across three stochastic volatility models and multiple hedging strategies yields several important conclusions that have significant implications for insurance enterprise risk management.

\subsection{Model Risk in Capital Calculations}

The research provides conclusive evidence that the choice of stochastic volatility model has material impact on capital requirement calculations for variable annuities. The differences are not merely academic but represent substantial practical implications:

\textbf{Quantitative Model Impact:} The unhedged capital requirements vary by more than 300\% across models, with the GBM model requiring \$540 per \$1,000 contract while Heston and rough volatility models require \$2,250. This \$1,710 difference per contract translates to millions of dollars in regulatory capital for typical insurance portfolios.

\textbf{Risk Distribution Characteristics:} While the GBM model produces relatively predictable risk distributions with moderate tail risks, the stochastic volatility models generate fat-tailed distributions with concentration at extreme loss levels. This concentration creates challenges for diversification and capital optimization that simple models fail to capture.

\textbf{Expected Loss Patterns:} The models generate dramatically different expected loss patterns, ranging from \$169 expected losses (Heston) to \$41 expected gains (rough volatility) per contract. These differences affect product pricing, profitability analysis, and business planning in ways that extend beyond capital management.

\subsection{Dynamic Hedging Effectiveness}

The analysis demonstrates that dynamic hedging provides substantial risk reduction across all models, though effectiveness varies significantly depending on the underlying volatility assumptions:

\textbf{Universal Risk Reduction:} All models show meaningful risk reduction from dynamic hedging, with volatility reductions ranging from 41\% to 53\%. This consistency suggests that hedging benefits are robust across different market behavior assumptions, providing confidence for practical implementation.

\textbf{Model-Dependent Performance:} Hedging effectiveness varies substantially across models. The GBM model achieves near-perfect hedging with complete elimination of loss scenarios, while stochastic volatility models retain significant residual risks even with optimal hedging. This reflects the fundamental challenges of hedging complex volatility dynamics with simple delta strategies.

\textbf{Economic Value Creation:} Dynamic hedging transforms loss-making unhedged positions into profit-generating hedged portfolios across all models. The mean profit improvement ranges from \$358 to \$842 per contract, providing substantial economic value that justifies hedging program costs.

\subsection{Capital Requirements and Regulatory Implications}

The analysis reveals significant implications for regulatory capital management and enterprise risk frameworks:

\textbf{Capital Relief Quantification:} Dynamic hedging provides capital relief ranging from \$688 to \$1,774 per contract, depending on the underlying model. These benefits substantially exceed typical hedging costs (2-4\% of notional), providing strong economic justification for hedging programs with return-on-investment ratios of 20:1 to 50:1.

\textbf{Regulatory Model Recognition:} The substantial differences across models highlight the importance of regulatory recognition of model sophistication in capital calculations. Simple models may systematically understate capital requirements, while sophisticated models may provide more conservative and realistic assessments.

\textbf{Hedging Program Economics:} The analysis demonstrates that hedging programs are economically justified across all modeling frameworks, though the magnitude of benefits varies. This provides objective support for insurance companies seeking to justify hedging program investments to stakeholders and regulators.

\section{Practical Implications for Insurance Companies}

The research findings have direct implications for insurance company risk management, capital planning, and business strategy decisions.

\subsection{Model Selection Guidance}

\textbf{Balance Sophistication with Implementation:} While sophisticated models like Heston and rough volatility provide more realistic risk assessments, they require substantially greater computational resources and technical expertise. Insurance companies must balance model realism with practical implementation constraints.

\textbf{Conservative Capital Planning:} The substantial differences in capital requirements across models suggest that conservative capital planning should consider the range of model predictions rather than relying on single-model estimates. Using multiple models can provide bounds on capital requirements and support more robust risk management decisions.

\textbf{Model Validation Importance:} The materiality of model differences emphasizes the critical importance of comprehensive model validation programs. Insurance companies should invest in robust validation frameworks that assess model performance across different market conditions and time periods.

\subsection{Hedging Program Design}

\textbf{Frequency Optimization:} The analysis suggests that weekly rebalancing provides an optimal balance between hedging effectiveness and transaction costs across most scenarios. Daily rebalancing provides marginal improvements that may not justify additional costs, while monthly rebalancing sacrifices meaningful hedging effectiveness.

\textbf{Cost-Benefit Framework:} The substantial capital relief from hedging provides clear economic justification for hedging programs. Insurance companies can use the quantified benefits to support business cases for hedging program implementation and optimization.

\textbf{Model-Adaptive Strategies:} More sophisticated models may require more nuanced hedging approaches beyond simple delta hedging. Insurance companies using advanced models should consider enhanced hedging strategies that address additional risk dimensions such as volatility risk and correlation risk.

\subsection{Enterprise Risk Management Integration}

\textbf{Capital Allocation Optimization:} The quantified capital benefits enable more sophisticated capital allocation decisions. Insurance companies can optimize their product mix and hedging strategies based on risk-adjusted return calculations that incorporate hedging benefits.

\textbf{Risk Appetite Calibration:} Understanding the range of outcomes across different models supports more informed risk appetite decisions. Companies can calibrate their risk limits based on empirically-derived risk distributions rather than theoretical assumptions.

\textbf{Regulatory Dialogue:} The evidence of substantial hedging benefits supports constructive dialogue with regulators regarding capital credit for hedging programs. Insurance companies can use quantified evidence to advocate for recognition of hedging benefits in regulatory capital calculations.

\section{Limitations and Future Research}

While this research provides valuable insights, several limitations suggest directions for future investigation.

\subsection{Current Limitations}

\textbf{Model Implementation:} The rough volatility model implementation uses simplified parameterization due to computational constraints. Future research could implement more sophisticated rough volatility frameworks with full market calibration to assess whether additional realism provides material improvements in risk assessment.

\textbf{Hedging Sophistication:} The analysis focuses on delta hedging strategies, which represent current industry practice but may not be optimal for complex stochastic volatility models. Advanced hedging approaches incorporating gamma, vega, and other risk dimensions could provide superior performance under sophisticated modeling assumptions.

\textbf{Parameter Stability:} The analysis assumes constant model parameters throughout contract periods, which may not reflect real-world parameter evolution. Dynamic recalibration approaches could provide more realistic assessments of long-term risk characteristics.

\textbf{Product Scope:} The focus on guaranteed minimum accumulation benefits represents one important product variant. Other variable annuity features such as withdrawal benefits, step-up provisions, and mortality/longevity risks could exhibit different model sensitivity and hedging effectiveness patterns.

\subsection{Future Research Directions}

\textbf{Multi-Asset Extensions:} Real variable annuity portfolios often include multiple underlying assets and currency exposures. Extending the analysis to multi-asset contexts would provide more practical guidance for portfolio-level risk management.

\textbf{Behavioral Modeling:} Policyholder behavior, including surrender patterns and benefit utilization decisions, can significantly affect variable annuity risk characteristics. Incorporating behavioral modeling would enhance the realism and practical applicability of the analysis.

\textbf{Machine Learning Applications:} Advanced machine learning techniques could potentially improve both model calibration and hedging strategy optimization. Exploring these approaches could identify opportunities for performance enhancement beyond traditional methods.

\textbf{Regulatory Capital Integration:} More detailed modeling of specific regulatory capital frameworks (Solvency II, NAIC risk-based capital, etc.) would provide more precise guidance for insurance companies operating under different regulatory regimes.

\section{Final Conclusions}

This dissertation provides comprehensive empirical evidence on the effects of stochastic volatility models and dynamic hedging strategies on capital requirements for equity-linked variable annuities. The research demonstrates that model choice has material implications for capital calculations, with differences of several hundred percent across modeling frameworks.

More importantly, the analysis shows that dynamic hedging provides substantial and quantifiable benefits across all models, with capital relief ranging from \$688 to \$1,774 per \$1,000 contract. These benefits provide strong economic justification for hedging program implementation while highlighting the importance of model selection for optimal risk management.

The findings bridge the gap between academic stochastic volatility research and practical insurance risk management, providing actionable guidance for industry practitioners while identifying important directions for future research. The evidence supports a more sophisticated approach to variable annuity risk management that recognizes both the opportunities and challenges created by complex financial market dynamics.

For the insurance industry, these results support investment in advanced risk management capabilities while emphasizing the practical benefits of dynamic hedging programs. For regulators, the analysis provides evidence for policy frameworks that recognize the value of sophisticated risk management while ensuring appropriate capital adequacy. For researchers, the work establishes a foundation for future investigations into the intersection of financial modeling and insurance risk management.

The variable annuity market will continue to evolve as demographic trends drive demand for retirement security products that provide equity market participation with downside protection. This research provides a foundation for understanding and managing the complex risks these products create, supporting the development of more sophisticated and effective risk management practices that benefit insurers, policyholders, and the broader financial system.
